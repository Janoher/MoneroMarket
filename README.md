# MoneroMarket
<h3>Marketplace but with cryptocurrencies only.</h3>

MoneroMarket was created as a way to be able to use cryptocurrencies as an actual currency to transact items, rather than just holding like a stock or a bond.
It was also created to allow for people to acquire cryptocurrencies without needing to have a bank account, as a person can just post an item for sale and receive
Monero in return, and then they are able to use their Monero however they like.

I focused on Monero because using Bitcoin or other public ledger cryptocurrencies raw the way they naturally work poses major privacy and security risks, however
implentation of a system to allow for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without mass unwarrented surveillance will be in the near future. I also wanted to create 
a website where people can buy and sell items without everybody in the world needing to know what they buy or sell online.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask following the tutorials of Corey Schafer on YouTube. <br />

There are also other people who have provided helpful resources online, and I site them within various locations in my source-code.

This is my very first website that I have ever built and deployed, and I hope that this website helps with the future adoption of cryptocurrencies and 
combating mass surveillance. If anyone feels like they want to help and contribute to spreading financial freedom to all, please consider contributing to the code
if you are a fellow developer, or by donating to the Monero address down below.
